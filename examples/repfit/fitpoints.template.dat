# Fitting points: x-val y-val
# Last line: r_damp(ignored), r_cutoff
# NOTABENE: 1. Exponential head is fitted from x[0]-0.5 to x[0]  au.
#           2. 5-th order polynomial extends from x[-1] to rcutoff.
#           3. For the available refdata, Mo-S bond varies between
#           4.35 au (2.3 A) and 4.97 au (2.63 A).
